Questions:
1. How have the sum of branch deposits changed at a State level from X to Y? And at a County level?
2. Have rural and urban areas experienced similar patterns of change, if any?
3. What are the outliers? Are any unexpected or interesting?
4. Can I use data to explore policy impacts? For example, exploring statistically significant
   moves in branches and deposits per state, finding out where in the state, and looking at
   overall state politics and county demographics/disasters to understand movements.

To-Do:
1. Organize code for flexibility & reproducibility

1. Find State and County (Census?) data for socioeconomic stats: population, race, income, education, health, rent
2. Add the variance of 10-year change, index by state and county

    i. Variance will be around the mean value. Value being change per 1000 people or percent change.
3. Visualize bivariate relations with one another using scatterplots
4. Determine classification for rural
5. Make OLS regression model for variance and rural

    i. What does it mean to be rural?
