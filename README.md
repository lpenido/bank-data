Questions:
1. How have the sum of branch deposits changed at a State level from X to Y? And at a County level? 
2. Have rural and urban areas experienced similar patterns of change, if any? 
3. What are the outliers? Are any unexpected or interesting? 

To-Do:
1. Get FDIC Data for X to Y 
2. Loop through to find yearly change for State and County
3. Vizualize State level change using heatmap of change across state and year change
4. Find State and County (Census?) data for socioeconomic stats: population, race, income, education, health, rent
5. Add the variance of 10-year change, index by state and county

    i. Variance will be around the mean value. Value being change per 1000 people or percent change. 
6. Vizualize bivariate relations with one another using scatterplots
7. Determine classification for rural
8. Make OLS regression model for varience and rural
