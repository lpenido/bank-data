## Mapping CRA Areas in America
The Communtiy Reinvestment Act (CRA) is the primary driver for subsidized housing production in the United States, cheifly through the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program (LIHTC). According to the CRA, Banks have to meet a quota of debt and equity service for an area in which they have a branch with deposits. The CRA quota can be met through purchasing LIHTC credits which are typically bought and sold in a market pricing system.

The pricing of a low-income housing tax credit will primarily depend on investor need in the area (as well a variety of project-level features). In major urban areas where banks have many branches and deposits, the pricing of the credits will often coincide with the demand for affordable housing. For example, in Los Angeles where there is a number of banks and an expensive real estate market the price of a credit will be high due to demand from banks and need for equity in projects. This trend of population ~ pricing follows closely save for the notable exceptions of Utah and South Dakota. But urban areas are not the only places with a dearth of subsidized housing. Rural projects are at a higher risk of being passed on as Investor need declines. 

Policymakers are then faced with a problem:
